<!-- Read This Before Starting An App -->

Name: Ecommmerce App(Frontend)

1) This is a react app(frontend);
2) This app is based on Ecommerce website.

Libraries used in Frontend:-

1) React via *yarn*
2) React Router Dom
3) Bootstrap CSS library
4) Bootstrap JS CDN
5) FontAwesome CSS CDN

Good About the site:

1) All things are responsive

Drawbacks:

1) Filter section is little bit less responsive while shrinking to medium devices.


Note:-

1) There is *auth* keyword in *FirstNav.js* file just to check whether it is working or not. I have used 1 and 0 to test whether the login and register buttons disappear when value is set to 1 or vice-versa.

2) To Run the App use *yarn start*

3) To install all dependencies use *yarn install*

4) There is an *assets* folder in the *src* folder includes --> images folder and data folder -> products.json file.
